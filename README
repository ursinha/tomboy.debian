Originally branched from git://git.debian.org/pkg-cli-apps/packages/tomboy.git to fetch debian files to build tomboy deb from current trunk, with applying TableOfContents addin created by Luc Pionchon (https://github.com/oluc/tomboy). Thanks Luc!

Bear with me as I'm learning git, I'm aware there are better ways to juggle patches. :)
