Originally cloned from git://git.debian.org/pkg-cli-apps/packages/tomboy.git to obtain current debian/ files. 

This branch allows the creation of a Tomboy .deb package that includes the TableOfContents addin created by Luc Pionchon (https://github.com/oluc/tomboy). Thanks Luc!

P.S.: Bear with me as I'm learning git, I'm aware there are better ways to juggle patches. :)
